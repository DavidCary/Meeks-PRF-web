    <p>
      Fill in the data for your election following the patterns of the sample
      input. The input uses the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types_and_syntax">
        JSON format
      </a>.
      Then click on / tap the "Tabulate" button to get results.
    </p>

    <h4>Shortcut for an array of strings</h4>
    <p>
      A common construct used in the input is a JSON array of strings.
      A JSON array encloses its items with square brackets, and individual items
      are separated by commas and optional white space (spaces, tabs, newlines,
      etc.).
      Strings are enclosed with double quotes. An example of an array with 5
      strings is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>["A", "B", "", "C", "D"]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However that can involve typing a lot of punctuation, and arrays of
      strings are used quite a lot.
      So the input also accepts a shortcut, called a delimiter-first string.
      The string values are all put in a single string and are separated by a
      delimiter-character that is whatever the first character of the string is.
      So the following delimiter-first strings are equivalent to and will be
      converted to the above array of strings:
    </p>
    <ul class='mono'>
      <li>" A B  C D"</li>
      <li>",A,B,,C,D"</li>
      <li>"|A|B||C|D"</li>
      <li>"+A+B++C+D"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The delimiter can be any character, but using a punctuation character
      is recommended.
      Using this shortcut, the empty string, "", indicates an empty array of
      strings, [ ].
    </p><p>
      This shortcut can be used to specify an array of strings for the
      "candidates", "tieBreaker", "excluded", and "protected" items,
      for the rankings of a ballot,
      and for specifying round-by-round values for the
      "alternative_defeats" options sub-item.
    </p>

    <h4>nbrSeatsToFill</h4>
    <p>
      The "nbrSeatsToFill" item indicates the number of winners that will be
      elected by the tabulation, unless there are fewer candidates which are
      not excluded.
    </p>

    <h4>candidates</h4>
    <p>
      The "candidates" item lists the ranking codes for each candidate.
      The list can be given as an array of strings or as a delimiter-first
      string.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ranking codes identify candidates and are typically shortened or
      abbreviated candidate names so that they are more easily used specify how
      candidates are ranked on ballots.
      No ranking code can begin with ":" or be equal to "#" or "".
    </p><p>
      The ranking codes should not include spaces, other white-space
      characters, or any of the following characters:
        '[:"]' (not including the enclosing single quotes).
      It is recommended that any punctuation in ranking codes be limited to
      hyphens, underscores, and periods and that the first character be an
      alphabetic letter.
      It can be helpful if the the ranking codes are all the same length.
    </p><p>
      For example, a candidate named Thomas Jefferson might be given a
      ranking code of "TJ", "TJ1", "TJeff", "ThJe", "ThomJ", or "ThomJeff".
      The order in which candidates are listed does not matter.
    </p>

    <h4>tieBreaker</h4>
    <p>
      The "tieBreaker" item is a list of candidates used to break ties for
      being defeated.
      Candidates are typically listed in a random order.
      The list of candidates can be given as an array of strings or as a
      delimiter-first string.
    </p><p>
      Among tied candidates, the candidate listed first in "tieBreaker" will be
      defeated.
      It is a tabulation error if a candidate is involved in a tie to be
      defeated but is not listed in the tieBreaker.
    </p>

    <h4>maxRankingLevels</h4>
    <p>
      The "maxRankingLevels" item indicates how many candidates a voter is
      allowed to rank.
      The number specified must be at least 3. A null value, the letters "null"
      without the quote marks, can be specified to indicate that there was no
      limit on how many candidates a voter could rank.
    </p><p>
      This item is used to determine whether exhausted votes are reported as
      abstentions.
      If a ballot is exhausted and the voter had the opportunity to rank
      additional candidates, but didn't, any portion of that ballot's vote
      which is not counting for a candidate is reported in the ":Abstentions"
      category.
    </p>

    <h4>excluded and protected candidates</h4>
    <p>
      The "excluded" item identifies candidates which are excluded (a.k.a.
      withdrawn) from the tabulation and are considered defeated before the
      first round of tabulation starts.
      The list of excluded candidates can be given as an array of strings or as
      a delimiter-first string.
      The order in which candidates are listed does not matter.
    </p><p>
      The "protected" item identifies candidates which are protected from
      defeat and as a result are guaranteed of being a elected.
      The list of candidates can be given as an array of strings or as a
      delimiter-first string.
      The order in which candidates are listed does not matter.
    </p><p>
      A re-tabulation of ballots to fill one or more vacancies can be
      accomplished by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Excluding any candidate who is not eligible or is unwilling to
        serve.</li>
      <li>Protecting any incumbents who will continue to
        serve.</li>
      <li>Setting the "nbrSeatsToFill" equal to the number of vacancies
        being filled, plus the number of protected candidates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The correct number of protected winners and the correct number of 
      unprotected winners in such a re-tabulation is ensured by using separate
      thresholds for each class of candidates.
    </p>

    <h4>ballots</h4>
    <p>
      The "ballots" item is specified as a JSON array of ballot groups.
      A ballot group represents one or more ballots with the same candidate 
      rankings.
      Use of ballot groups allows ballots to be specified in a summarized and
      typically more compact format.
    </p><p>
      Each ballot group is specified as a JSON array of two items: the number
      of ballots in the group and the candidate rankings for those ballots.
      The candidate rankings can be given as an array of strings or as a
      delimiter-first string.
      The candidate rankings list the first-choice candidate first, the
      second-choice candidate second, etc.
      All of the ballots represented by a ballot group have the same candidate
      rankings.
    </p><p>
      The empty string, "", represents a ranking level without a ranked
      candidate.
      Such unused rankings can be omitted, since their presence does not change
      how votes are counted.
      Use a ranking code of "#" to represent an overvoted ranking, i.e. a
      ranking level at which more than one candidate was ranked.
    </p><p>
      Note that the last two-item array representing the last ballot group
      is not followed by a comma.
      Instead it is followed by the right square bracket
      that closes the list of ballot groups.
    </p><p>
      If the ballots and ballot rankings are available in some other format
      and there are very many of them, it may be worthwhile to format the data
      using another tool, for example using a spreadsheet.
    </p>

    <h4>options</h4>
    <p>
      The "options" item identifies various alternative ways to perform the
      tabulation.
      If an options sub-item is not specified, a default value, the
      value first listed below, takes effect.
      Using the defaults by specifying an empty options value, { }, is usually
      a good way to run a tabulation, unless there are specific reasons to use
      other values.
    </p><p>
      The recognized options sub-items and their allowed values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
          "alternative_defeats" specifies whether more than one candidate is
          allowed to be defeated in a round, subject to various conditions that
          generally are designed to ensure that multiple defeats will not
          change who is elected.
          Valid values are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"N", which disallows checking for alternative defeats in all
            rounds.</li>
          <li>"Y", which allows checking for alternative defeats in any
            round.</li>
          <li>an array or a delimiter-first string of "Y" and "N" values in any
            combination, one for each round of the tabulation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>
          "type_of_altdefs" specifies when during a round any checking for
          alternative defeats is performed, if it has been allowed by the
          "alternative_defeats" option.  Valid values are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"per_reference_rule", which will follow the optional provisions
            for "Multiple simultaneous defeats" in the reference rule.
            That will check for alternative defeats every iteration, provided
            that no candidates have been elected in the round and the round
            will require at least one more iteration.
            This can mean that there is no checking for alternative defeats in
            a round which finishes in just one iteration, for example in a
            first round that does not elect anyone.</li>
          <li>"if_no_new_electeds", which will check for alternative defeats in
            every iteration, provided that no candidates have been elected in
            the round, but regardless of whether the round requires another
            iteration.
            Specifying "if_no_new_electeds" produces the combined effects of
            both "per_reference_rule" and "before_single_defeats".</li>
          <li>"before_single_defeats", which will check for alternative defeats
            only at the end of a round in which no candidates have been
            elected, and just before a regular single defeat would be
            required.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><p>
          "always_count_votes" specifies whether votes should always be
          counted in a first round, even if the winners can be determined
          without any rounds of tabulation, i.e. when the number on
          non-excluded candidates is equal to or less than the number of seats
          to fill.
          Valid values are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>true, which requires that votes to be tabulated for at least the
            first round.</li>
          <li>false, which follows the reference rule and avoids all rounds of
            tabulations if the number of non-excluded candidates is equal to or
            less than the number of seats to fill.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, specifying an empty options value, { }, is equivalent to
      specifying the options item with all of its default values:
    </p>
    <pre>
  ,"options": {
    "alternative_defeats": "N",
    "type_of_altdefs": "per_reference_rule",
    "always_count_votes": true
  }
    </pre>

    <h4>JSON format errors</h4>
    <p>
      If the input data is not in a valid JSON format, for example maybe it
      has a missing comma or an extra comma somewhere, trying to perform a
      tabulation will result in a JSON parse syntax error being reported.
      The error message will indicate the row and column where an error was
      detected.
      To find the corresponding place in the input data, it may be helpful to
      copy and paste the input data into a text editor that reports the row and
      column of the cursor.
      The place where the input data needs to be corrected may be at an earlier
      point in the input data, but the spot indicated by the error message is a
      good place to start looking for problems.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Browser-based tabulations</h4>
    <p>
      This web page does not send any of your election data to the web server
      or anywhere else on the network.
      The web server is only used to provide the files needed to display the
      web page.
      The vote tabulations are performed entirely within your browser on your
      computer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One important consequence is that this web page does not save any of
      your data.
      If you need to save your input data or the tabulation results,
      you should do that by copying and pasting the data to another program,
      for example a text editor or a spreadsheet, and then using that program
      to save your data.
    </p>


    <h4>Results</h4>
    <p>
      A successful tabulation shows the results in a JSON format in three
      parts.
      Both the Status and Tally parts are displayed as JSON fragments.
      They are also displayed in a format that allows each part to be copied and
      pasted into a spreadsheet for further use.
    </p><p>
      For example, for the Tally results, copying the data into a spreadsheet
      and then using a text-to-columns command can split the data into a
      tabular format showing vote totals by round.  Use of a text-to-columns
      command should recognize as separators:
      spaces, commas, and all of the characters in '[:"]' (not
      including the enclosing single quotes).
      It should also merge delimiters. If the spreadsheet program, such as
      LibreCalc, offers an option to recognize special numbers, that option
      should be activated. 
    </p><p>
      In Microsoft Excel, it may be necessary to first use "Find & Select" /
      "Replace" to first remove the square brackets and the double quote
      characters in the Tally data before using the text-to-columns command.
    </p><p>
      Each line of the status data shows in order:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The candidate's name / ranking code.</li>
      <li>Whether the candidate was elected or defeated.</li>
      <li>The round in which the candidate was elected or defeated.</li>
      <li>The number of votes the candidate had when elected or defeated.</li>
      <li>The candidate's keep value at the end of the last round.</li>
      <li>If the candidate was protected or excluded, a string indicating
        that.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A candidate's keep value for the last round is a value between zero and
      one which indicates what portion of votes were kept and counted for that
      candidate in the last round.
      For candidates elected before the last round, it will typically be
      a value less than one but more than zero.
      For example if a candidate is reported to have 300.0 votes in the last
      round and a last-round keep value of 0.75, that tells us that in the last
      round the candidate received about 400.0 votes, but about 100.0 of those
      votes were transferred as surplus from the candidate.
    </p><p>
      In both the Status and Tally parts, candidates are listed in an order
      that reflects the progress of round-by-round tabulation results:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Elected candidates are listed before defeated candidates.</li>
      <li>Elected candidates are listed in the order they were elected.</li>
      <li>Defeated candidates are listed in the reverse order that they were
        defeated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Among the benefits of using that ordering is that the candidates
      still competing to be the last candidate(s) elected in the last round are
      listed close to each other.
